Simple printing script that pretty much acts like the worse screenshotting software known to man (or maybe I'm uninformed and there's something far worse than this.)

Make sure you have MSPaint open and that you configure all of the values before running this, otherwise it could spam open files or links or whatever happens to be under the mouse.
